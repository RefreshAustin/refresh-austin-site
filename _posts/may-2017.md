Manton Reece
It used to be that if you wanted to write on the web, you posted to your own blog. Now, most text and photos go into closed platforms like Twitter and Facebook. But what if we could bring the UI innovations of today's social networks and apply them to blogs and independent publishing? In this talk we'll explore why it's important to control your own content, the problems with today's social networks, the rise of Mastodon, and the architecture of Micro.blog. We'll go over steps for starting a microblog with WordPress and integrating it into a growing ecosystem of indie microblogs.
