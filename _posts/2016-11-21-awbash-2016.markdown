THE BIGGEST HOLIDAY PARTY IS BACK

Every year, Refresh Austin hosts the Austin Web Bash, or #AWBASH, to bring Austin's web and tech meetups together under one roof to celebrate the end of the year.

**RSVP ON EVENTBRITE: [awbash2016.eventbrite.com](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/awbash-2016-tickets-28917528105)**

An RSVP on meetup does not RSVP you for the event, you must RSVP on Eventbrite.

2016 Benefited Nonprofit: ChickTech

This year, we are raising funds for [ChickTech Austin](http://austin.chicktech.org/), a nonprofit dedicated to retaining women in the technology workforce and increasing the number of women and girls pursuing technology-based careers. All ticket sales will go straight to supporting ChickTech Austin.
