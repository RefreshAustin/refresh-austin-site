Drive Revenue with a Data-Driven Product  
Michelle Greer  
How do SaaS companies like Dropbox, Slack, and Github crush revenue figures when they have small Sales Teams and a free price tag? This talk explains what Product, Engineering, and Marketing Teams need to consider to go freemium. We'll go over the requirements, metrics, tools, and gotchas of this model. We'll also compare how a freemium model evolves as your company grows from startup to major player in the space.
By the end of this talk, you, as a builder, should feel empowered. Good companies should be driven by data and good products -- not by giant teams of enterprise salespeople!
