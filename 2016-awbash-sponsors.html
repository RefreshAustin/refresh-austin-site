title: AWBASH 2016 Needs Your Help!
---

<p>
  AWBASH is an exciting event that we hold each year thanks to the generosity
  of so many sponsors. This event not only provides a great opportunity to
  get to know the whole Austin tech community, it also raises funds for great
  charities. Last year, we donated $4,000 to <a href="https://genaustin.org/">GENAustin</a>.
  This year's event is slated to support <a href="http://austin.chicktech.org/">ChickTECH Austin</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Sadly, this year we've had a tough time lining up sponsors to help cover the cost.
  We really want to pull this off, but to do so, we need your help to find
  sponsors by Sunday, November 27. In total, we need to raise $8,500. Can you help?
</p>

<p>
  If you are a group, company, or individual who's interested in helping, please
  reach out to <a href="mailto:contact@refreshaustin.org">contact@refreshaustin.org</a>
  as quickly as possible. If you have any questions or need any additional info,
  please don't hestiate to ask!
